Implementation, Results and Discussion
======================================

Implementation and Methodology
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The implementation of the proposed method is done using the Python programming language and using Ad Hoc Computing (AHC) Framework.
AHC is a event-driven framework that allows user to simulate distributed systems with different topologies. Awerbuch's and Cidon's algorithms'
were published in 1985 and 1989 respectively as papers. Both algorithms had pseudocode implementations and explanations in detail within the papers. These pseudocode implementations
and explanations were used to implement the algorithms in Python. The implementation of the algorithms were done in a way that they can be used in
AHC framework.



Results

TODO for 8 May 2024 where testing will be done and results will be available.
